Construction of the project: I will ensure that every component is accurate. Link: I'll create the project's link using the GitHub desktop application.

# Version Control
I will use Version Control for the code and to test it before it is made available to the public to make sure everything runs smoothly and functions as intended.

# Run the Project
Personal editor pages with a Github link are the subject of the project. There are fewÂ pages in total to navigate. The home page will serve as the main page. It will take you to the Services if you scroll down. You will be taken to a new page with various custom edits I've made when you click on those.
